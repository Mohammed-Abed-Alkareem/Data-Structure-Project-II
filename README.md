# Data-Structure-Project-II
calculator system that reads a number of equations from an input file to be evaluated.


# Summary
implementation to	a	calculator system	that reads a	
number	of	equations	from an input	file to	be	evaluated.	The	file	will	
contain	an	unspecified	number	of	equations written	in	infix	form.	Your	
program	should	be	able	to	read	all	equations	in	the	file.

# Specifications
application	should	be	able	to	perform	the	following	tasks:
1. Read the	file	containing	the	equations.	The user	should	provide	the	
name	of	the	input	file.
2. Check	the	validity	of	equations	(either	valid	or	not).	
3. Convert	valid	equations	from	infix	to	prefix and	print	the	prefix
expressions.
4. Evaluate	the	prefix expressions and	print	the	results	of	each	equation	on	a	separate	line
5. Print	invalid equations. This	option	should	print	all	invalid	equations	from	the	input	file.
6. Print	all	equations	to	a	file	(output.txt)	indicating	for	each	input	equation	if	it	is	valid	or	not	and	if	valid,	print	out	the	prefix	expression and	its result.
7. Exit.
